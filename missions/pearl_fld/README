Single vehicle mission designed for field deployment on the PEARL autonomous platform.

Launch instructions:

(shoreside terminal)
>> ./launch_shoreside.sh

**note that the proper shore/vehicle IP addresses and ports must be specified
either in the launch_shoreside.sh executable or at the command line. Type
./launch_shoreside.sh -h for a full list of possible command line arguments.

(remote vehicle terminal)
>> ./launch_vehicle.sh

**note that the proper shore/vehicle IP addresses and ports must be specified
either in the launch_vehicle.sh executable or at the command line. Type
./launch_vehicle.sh -h for a full list of possible command line arguments.


Variables/Parameters to adjust:

-Shoreside laptop and PEARL RPi IP addresses (SHORE_IP, PEARL_IP)
	Location: launch_vehicle.sh, launch_shoreside.sh
	Note that we can specify these IP addresses as command line arguments
	when running either script, but for simplicity it makes sense to 
	just change the defaults in the code.
**The ports that MOOS-IvP uses to communicate between shore/PEARL are also set
in the launch scripts. You shouldn't need to change these, but that's where
they are just in case.

-PEARL waypoint cruise speed (CRUISESPEED)
	Location: launch_vehicle.sh
	This is the speed PEARL will set when moving between waypoints.
	Currently speed is set to 0.3 m/s.

-Station-keeping radius (inner_radius, outer_radius, hibernation_radius)
	Location: meta_vehicle.bhv
	The important thing here is inner_radius, which defines the area within
	which PEARL can drift while station-keeping. Currently inner_radius
	is set to 5 meters.
