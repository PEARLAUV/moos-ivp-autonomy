The contact at Bud Industries is Lester Miller. The procedure for ordering more boxes is:
1. Email him a PDF including mechanical drawings. In the body of the email say ÿÿWe are seeking a quote for the attached design."
2. He reviews the drawings and asks questions if required.
3. A Newark salsesperson contacts you with the quote. In our case it was Maria Adinolfi.
4. There may be a back-and-forth to get the quote correct
5. We ok and pay for the order, they make it, and ship it to us.
